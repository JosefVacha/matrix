"""
FreqAI Hook Functions for MATRIX Feature Engineering.

These functions serve as the bridge between MATRIX's feature engineering
and FreqAI's training/inference pipeline. All functions are designed to
maintain temporal integrity and prevent data leakage.

Contract Requirements:
- All functions must preserve DataFrame index alignment
- No future information leakage in features/labels
- Robust handling of NaN values with telemetry logging
- Type hints and comprehensive docstrings required

See docs/CONTRACTS.md for detailed I/O specifications.
See docs/LABELS.md for label generation semantics.

    Generate model-ready features from OHLCV data for FreqAI training/inference.
    
    This function transforms raw OHLCV data into features suitable for machine learning.
    Must preserve temporal order and prevent any future information leakage.
    
    Args:
        df_ohlcv: DataFrame with OHLCV data, datetime index required.
                 Columns: ['open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume']
    
    Returns:
        DataFrame with generated features, same index as input.
        Column names should follow feature_columns() registry.
    
    Contract:
        - MUST preserve df_ohlcv.index exactly
        - MUST NOT use future information (no forward-looking calculations)
        - MUST log NaN ratio via telemetry.log_nan_ratio()
        - SHOULD handle missing data gracefully
        - Feature columns MUST match feature_columns() output
    
    TODO:
        - Implement technical indicators (SMA, RSI, MACD, etc.)
        - Add volume-based features
        - Implement robust NaN handling strategy
        - Add feature scaling/normalization

    Generate prediction labels from OHLCV data using lookahead methodology.
    
    Creates labels for supervised learning based on future price movements.
