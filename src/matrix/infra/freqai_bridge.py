"""
FreqAI Bridge Module.

Interface for FreqAI integration providing model training and inference capabilities.
This module serves as the connection point between MATRIX's feature engineering
and FreqAI's ML pipeline.

Contract: 
- prepare_training_data(ohlcv) → (features, labels) 
- prepare_inference_data(ohlcv_tail) → features
- train_model(features, labels) → model_artifacts
- predict(model, features) → predictions

See docs/CONTRACTS.md for detailed I/O specifications.
See docs/LABELS.md for label generation semantics.
