    Convert ML predictions to trading signals using threshold-based logic.

    Args:
        predictions: ML predictions from FreqAI (e.g., return forecasts)
        context: Contextual information (current price, indicators, position state, etc.)

    Returns:
        Dict with signals: {
            'enter_long': bool,

    Contract:
        - Signals must be deterministic for given inputs
        - Compatible with Freqtrade strategy interface
        - Follow docs/THRESHOLDS.md methodology

    TODO: Implement threshold-based signal generation (see docs/THRESHOLDS.md)

    Decision Rules Reference (see docs/THRESHOLDS.md "Decision Rules" section):
    - Use distribution-based selection for UP/DOWN positioning near tails
    - Apply signal rate optimization to hit target trigger frequency bands
    - Size hysteresis based on typical prediction noise from sandbox results
    - Set cooldown to ceil(median hold time) from REPORT_TEMPLATE.md analysis
    - Prioritize stability across WFO blocks over peak single-period performance

    Data-Driven Implementation (see docs/REPORT_TEMPLATE.md "Thresholds Extraction"):
    - Extract prediction distribution statistics (mean, std, percentiles) from first sandbox run
    - Analyze actual trigger rates vs. target bands from backtest results
    - Apply decision rules systematically to derive concrete threshold values
    - Document rationale linking sandbox data to threshold proposals

    Grid Sweep (Step 1 from THRESHOLDS.md):
    - UP_THRESHOLD: TODO - define minimum prediction for long entry
    - DOWN_THRESHOLD: TODO - define maximum prediction for short entry
    - HYSTERESIS: TODO - implement buffer to prevent oscillation
    - COOLDOWN: TODO - minimum bars between signal changes

    WFO Evaluation (Step 2 from THRESHOLDS.md):
    - TODO: Load optimized thresholds from WFO validation results
    - TODO: Apply thresholds with stability-focused selection criteria
    - TODO: Implement composite scoring (hit rate + stability + drawdown guard)

    Stability Check (Step 3 from THRESHOLDS.md):
    - TODO: Use thresholds validated across multiple WFO blocks
    - TODO: Prefer consistent performance over peak single-block results
    - TODO: Monitor threshold effectiveness and parameter drift

    Signal Logic Implementation:
    - TODO: Long Entry: prediction > UP_THRESHOLD
    - TODO: Short Entry: prediction < DOWN_THRESHOLD
    - TODO: Long Exit: prediction < (UP_THRESHOLD - HYSTERESIS)
    - TODO: Short Exit: prediction > (DOWN_THRESHOLD + HYSTERESIS)
    - TODO: Cooldown enforcement: wait COOLDOWN bars after any signal
    - TODO: Neutral zone: no signals in hysteresis band

    Context Integration:
    - TODO: Use context['current_position'] for position-aware signaling
    - TODO: Apply context['market_conditions'] for regime-specific thresholds
    - TODO: Integrate context['risk_budget'] for position sizing hints
