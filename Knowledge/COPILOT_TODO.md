# Copilot Routine TODOs
# QA & Ingest Additions
- [ ] Propose running qa-docs-consistency.py before each DRY run to prevent doc drift.

- [ ] Scan for inconsistencies between CONTRACTS/LABELS and mapping.py docstrings; propose doc fix.
- [ ] Offer to convert SIM parameters into a draft TS_*.yml (no numbers auto-filled; user confirms).
- [ ] Suggest updates to THRESHOLDS.md based on SIM findings (phrasing only).
- [ ] Keep ROADMAP.md “Exit criteria” tight and actionable; propose clarifications.
